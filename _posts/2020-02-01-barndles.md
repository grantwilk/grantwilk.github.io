BARNDLES is a crazy computing project that involves designing an ISA, microarchitecture, assembler, and software tools in order to build a functioning computer in Blender, a 3D modeling software that was never meant to run such a thing.

What does BARNDLES stand for?

- **B**lender
- **A**lgorithmic
- **R**endering and
- **N**ode
- **D**riven
- **L**ogic
- **E**mulation
- **S**ystem

The processor is designed to operate in Blender's shader node editor, a forward processing and Turing complete component of the software. Memory writeback is conducted by mapping the memory image onto a plane and rendering it using Blender's Cycles rendering engine.

The process is goofy, but it actually works. A demonstration can be seen in the video below.

While this project was anything but practical, it was an AMAZING exercise in outside-the-box thinking and technical design. I had the opportunity to experience the full breadth of CPU design including ISA design, microarchitecture implementation, assembler implementation, and thorough project documentation.

Below is a sample of the ISA documentation I created to describe the microprocessor's functionality. The completed project (including the Blender files and ISA documents) can be found on in the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/grantwilk/barndles).

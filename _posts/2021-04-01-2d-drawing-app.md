A 2D drawing application implemented from scratch and compiled for Linux.

As part of my Computer Graphics course, we learned all the tools necessary to create a 2D line-drawing application from scratch using C++ and nothing but the X11 library's `setPixel()` function. We had the opportunity to create our own line drawing algorithms, devise a polymorphic shape hierarchy, explore text-based file I/O, and apply our knowledge of 2D transformations that we learned in class.

I won't go into excessive detail with this project because I believe it's fairly straightforward, but I do think it's a neat creation! Here's a demo showing you what it's capable of:

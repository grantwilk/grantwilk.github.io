### The Problem

I run a YouTube channel called [Remington Creative](https://www.youtube.com/c/remingtoncreative) where I host live streams called [Chaos Modeling Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSvCk9Je4F2s15DxidDfboSWMGcwuXG1W). To maximize the quality of these streams, I needed a chaotic subject generator with a clean-looking GUI.

### The Plan

Use Java and JavaFX (with FXML) to develop a standalone subject generator application that can be easily packaged and distributed as an executable JAR.

The Chaos Subject Generator should accomplish the following goals:

1. Generate crazy but cool subjects that can be 3D modeled on stream  
2. Provide multiple subject formats so subjects don't get boring  
3. Allow the generator's adjectives, nouns, and verbs to be customized by the user  
4. Implement a programmable timer to put a time constraint on the challenge  
5. Buffer generated subjects so users can go back if they pass one they like  
6. Allow users to enter seeds for random generation  
7. Design a sleek and minimal GUI so it fits seamlessly into the live stream

### The Result (So Far...)

Although it is not yet complete, the main functionality of the Chaos Subject Generator has been implemented and it has been used on my Chaos Modeling Challenge streams multiple times.

Unfortunately, my classwork and extra-curricular involvement impedes on the time I have to work on personal projects, so development has been postponed until my calendar opens up a bit.

### The Future

Development of the Chaos Subject Generator will be continued!

I'd like to revisit this project during the summer of 2020, so that I can share the application with other artists who would like to try the Chaos Modeling Challenge themselves.

Until then, an [alpha release](https://github.com/grantwilk/chaos-subject-generator/releases/tag/v1.0a) of the Chaos Modeling Generator can be found on the project's GitHub repository.

An orthographic 3D wireframe renderer, written from scratch and compiled for Linux.

As an extension of the [2D Drawing App](/posts/2021-04-01-2d-drawing-app) I made for my Computer Graphics course, I decided to add some 3D rendering capabilities. I had the opportunity to dive deep into 3D transformations to produce a 3D orthographic wireframe renderer with mouse control.

Having been a bit of a 3D junkie since 8th grade, this was an amazing project to work on. I've wondered how rendering engines work for so long now, and to finally have some degree of an answer is incredibly satisfying. I'm considering continuing my work on this over the summer by adding features like solid faces, z-buffering, flat shading, and smooth shading. We'll have to see what I can get around to though!

In the meantime, here's a neat demo!

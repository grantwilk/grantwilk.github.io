"D-NOISE" is a personal project I initiated in 2019, driven by my passion for enhancing Blender's rendering capabilities. Upon discovering NVIDIA's OptiX AI-Accelerated Denoiser, one of the pioneering AI-driven denoising algorithms, I saw an opportunity to elevate Blender's default denoising quality. Inspired by the impressive standalone performance of the OptiX denoiser, I developed a Blender plugin that seamlessly integrates this technology. The plugin works by passing rendered images from Blender's image editor through the OptiX AI Denoiser, utilizing multi-pass rendering techniques that include albedo and normal passes, among others, to achieve superior denoising results.

Remarkably, D-NOISE was compatible with systems running NVIDIA GTX 600 series cards or newer, making it accessible and efficient. As my first product, D-NOISE quickly gained traction, amassing thousands of downloads in just a few weeks. Its impact was further highlighted when it was featured at the 2019 Blender Conference during Gleb Alexandrov's talk, marking it as the first AI denoiser implemented in Blender.

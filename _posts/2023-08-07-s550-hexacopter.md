In the summer of 2023, my work on some large drone prototypes at a startup inspired me to build my own hexacopter as a learning tool.

I started by acquiring an S550 hexacopter airframe and some cheap motors and ESCs to go along with it. To mirror the startup's flight electronics suite, I used a Pixhawk 6X flight controller running the PX4 software stack for the vehicles flight control system, a SIYI datalink air unit and ground controller (later replaced with a Herelink), and a SIYI A8 Mini gimbal-controlled camera.

The whole journey involved assembling the drone, configuring the PX4 firmware to interface with each peripheral, fine-tuning its flight characteristics for stable flight, and configuring the TCP/IP based downlink for both MAVLink telemetry and RTSP video so that it was compatible with our startup's in-house software. The end product was a solid hexacopter drone with autonomous flight capability, MAVLink compatibility, and an excellent platform to develop future vehicles on.

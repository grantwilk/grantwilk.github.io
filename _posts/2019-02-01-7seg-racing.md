The "7-Segment Racing Game" is an FPGA-based two-player racing game designed for my Digital Logic II class. It leverages an Intel MAX 10 FPGA and was programmed using schematic editors in Quartus. Players race by taking turns pressing a button as quickly as possible, moving a dot around a 7-segment display loop. The game times each player's lap and determines the winner based on the fastest time, displaying a victory message at the end. It's a fun and interactive way to showcase digital logic design skills!

Here's a short video showing off the project!

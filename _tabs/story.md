# My Story

Hi, I'm Grant! I'm a System Software Engineer at NVIDIA with an affinity for entrepreneurship and working in startups. I specialize in firmware engineering, embedded hardware, computer graphics, and bringing brilliant ideas to life.

The only way to predict the future is to build it yourself. This is a mantra I picked up when I first started my entrepreneurial journey at age 16. While most of my peers were busy wrangling part-time jobs, I chose to create something of my own, Remington Creative, a YouTube channel dedicated to teaching and exploring computer graphics.

I spent 4 years growing Remington Creative into a thriving online community with more than 80,000 members and a net viewership of over 400,000 hours (45+ years). As demand for my educational resources increased, I began to produce software tools that amassed hundreds of daily users. Ultimately, this lead me into a university education at the Milwaukee School of Engineering where I honed my technical and leadership skills.

Today, I'm a partial owner and technical leader of a startup that is revolutionizing aerial vehicle software, building novel eVTOL vehicles, and making the freedom of mobility accessible to everyone.
